Hello everyone!

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Today, I will be showing you how to create miniature programs within Excel’s Developer Tab in order to automate repetitive tasks or to create key-bound shortcuts within your spreadsheet

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,500
These user-created miniature programs are called Macros, and their purpose in life is to save you time. 
 
4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
In this video, we will cover
 
5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
Accessing and Enabling the Developer Tab in Excel
 
6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,500
Recording, Editing and Using a Macro
 
7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And, near the end of the video, a follow along example
 
8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let us start with Accessing and Enabling the Developer Tab. 
 
10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
These are the following step you will need to follow:
11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Step 1 – Open Excel
 
12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Step 2 – First, click on the File tab in the top left corner and then clicks Options in the bottom left corner to open Excel Options.
 
13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Step 3 - In the Excel Options window, find and select Customize Ribbon.
 
14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Step 4 - In the Customize Ribbon menu, find the Main Tabs window (on the far right).
 
15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,700
In this window, find the Developer checkbox (at the bottom of the page), and check it. 
 
16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,500
This will add the Developer tab to your Excel ribbon.
 
17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
[Pause]
 
18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If you come back to the main tab, you will now see that the Developer tab is enabled. 
 
19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Next, Let’s move on to Recording, Editing and Using a Macro.
 
20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,400
These are the step you will need to follow:
 
21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,000
Step 1 – Click on the newly added Developer tab in the main menu to display the developer ribbon. 
 
22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Step 2 - In the Developer ribbon, click on Record Macro.
 
23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,500
Step 3 – When the Macro Settings dialog box appears, enter content, or select options in each of the fields.
 
24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
These are:
 
25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The Macro name field, which gives your macro a name (no spaces, start with a letter)
 
26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Store macro in field, which chooses where to save the macro.
 
27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The Shortcut key field, which assigns a shortcut key if you want to run the macro with a keyboard shortcut. (It has as to be a Letter)
 
28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,500
And the Description field, which adds a description of what your macro does.
 
29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Step 4 - After configuring the settings, click OK to start recording the macro.
 
30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Step 5 - Perform the tasks in Excel that you want to automate. 
 
31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Excel is now recording any actions you make. 
 
32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,500
Step 6 - Once you’ve completed recording the series of actions you want to automate, go back to the Developer Ribbon, and click Stop Recording.
 
33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Congratulations! You have just created your very own Macro!
 
34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Step 7 - You can run the macro by first going to the Developer ribbon, clicking "Macros" to open the Macro dialog box, then selecting the macro you want to run, and then clicking Run.
 
35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It’s as simple as that!
 
36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If you found this confusing, do not worry. 
 
37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In this next segment we will create a macro together, in the form of a shortcut to quickly hide and unhide data.
 
38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:20,000
As an example, when presenting data to my colleagues I find it annoying to have to show 28 columns of data when just a couple of them are relevant to our discussion. 
 
39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,700
The Macro we will make together will turn this!
 
40
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,500
into this!
 
41
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,500
by a simple press of a shortcut key!
 
42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Here are the steps we need to take:
 
43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Step 1 - Access the Developer tab on the main Ribbon: 
 
44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Step 2 - Press Record Macro
 
45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Step 3 - Edit Macro Settings:
 
46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We’ll assign the name HideColumns and use command+K as our keybind. 
 
47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,700
We’ll then choose where to store the macro.
 
48
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,000
Then Click OK to start recording.
 
49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Step 4 – We need to Hide the Columns:
 
50
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,000
First, select the rows you wish to hide by clicking on the column’s letters on the top side of the Excel window. (You can select multiple columns by pressing Ctrl and right clicking)
 
51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Then, Right-click the selected columns and choose Hide from the context menu.
 
52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,000
Step 5 - Stop Recording: Go back to the Developer tab and click on Stop Recording.
 
53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Your Macro that quickly hides these columns is now done!
 
54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,700
Now for this last step, try to do it yourself. Pause the video and create a Macro to Unhide columns.
 
55
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,000
 If you are unsure on how to proceed, head back to the start of the video for a quick reminder.
(To unhide columns, select the columns surrounding the hidden columns and press the unhide button)
 
56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
[Pause] Try it yourself!
 
57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Here is the final product! 
 
58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You now have a Shortcut to hide and unhide rows. 
(Run the Macro and try it out for yourself!)
 
59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,500
This concludes this video tutorial. 
 
60
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Let us make a small recap of what we learned today:
 
61
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
We learned where to find the developer tab and how to enable it.
 
62
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,500
We also learned how to record, edit, and run macros. 
 
63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:03,000
I hope these tools will permit you to automate your Excel Spreadsheets in your future and save you valuable time.
 
64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thanks for watching and have a wonderful day!
