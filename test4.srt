00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hi everyone and welcome to today’s presentation on Why should you learn and use Solidworks!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here is a summary of what we will talk over today:

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,500
We will first start by asking what Solidworks is 

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Why choose Solidworks and not another program

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's use cases 

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,500
And if you were not convinced, current Purdue users of Solidworks

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Let’s first start with what is Solidworks

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:40,500
Solidworks is a CAD software, or Computer Aided Design Software. CAD software enable engineers, designers, and manufacturers to create, simulate, publish, and manage 3D models

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,000
It was developed in 1995 by Dassault Systems and offers a wide variety of capabilities. 

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,500
These capabilities include:

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,500
CAD, which gives you the ability to model almost about anything.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,000
CFD, which can simulate fluid dynamics over your model.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,500
FEA, which simulates stress over your model.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Electrical Modeling which allows you to draw and test circuitry inside your model. 

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And Drafting and CAM, which are essential to be able to manufacture your models. 

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
All of this is integrated into one package which makes your life simpler.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It also has many plugins which further enables you to just do about anything in the world of modeling.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Let’s now compare Solidworks to other popular CAD programs! 

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
The most popular programs are:

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,000
AutoCAD, Fusion360 and CATIA

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Solidworks is simply better due to its software being much more user friendly, cheaper in most cases, has lesser power requirements and thus is more accessible and is generally preferred when talking to manufacturers. 

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let’s now Jump forward and look at its use cases.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,500
For now, we’ll examine why this software is useful to an engineer.

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,000
First, it is expected as a base skill for any engineer, thus knowing how to CAD is a must.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Second, it is a fantastic tool to solve real-world problem such as making a new part and seeing if the new design will fit.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,500
Third, models give a better picture to people that may not be familiar with your field.

27
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,500
And lastly, for any kind of precision manufacturing like in the automotive and aerospace industry, you simply cannot make anything without it.

28
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:40,000
Solidworks is also a steppingstone towards much higher fidelity simulation software for CFD and FEA as well as it prepares you for large team collaboration.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We’ll now examine why this software is useful to anyone:

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,500
With the recent evolution and the mass marketization of 3D printing, modeling is going to become an essential skill to have for your everyday life.

31
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:06,000
3D printing can solve your problems in the real world. For example, it can fix a broken sink tube or create a missing headphone stand for your desk or even help you prototype ideas. 

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,500
Understanding how to model will also translate to improvement in other areas such as home improvement and the gestion of space.

33
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,000
It can even give a better understanding of complex systems such as your car for better repairs.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
SolidWorks can even enhance your career or simply give you new opportunities:

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It can help Product designers better understand and explain their pitches.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It can help manufacturers to streamline communication with engineers. 

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It can help Salespeople sell more product due to better visuals.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,500
The list goes on.

39
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,000
It can even increase your problem-solving skills!

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Still not convinced?

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,500
Groups like PSP (Purdue Space Program) or Purdue FSAE, two of the most well-known and biggest groups on campus, all use Solidworks

42
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Researchers at Purdue, such as the folks over at the propulsion labs at Zucrow also use Solidworks.

43
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,500
The machining services for Purdue as well use Solidworks.

44
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,000
If everyone is using it, why shouldn’t you?

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,500
There is also a free trial available for the latest Solidworks release available on www.solidworks.com

46
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you for listening to this presentation.
